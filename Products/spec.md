# Research-CLI Specifications

## 1. Introduction

Research-CLI is a command-line interface designed to streamline the research process. It provides a suite of tools for fetching, analyzing, and managing research papers, leveraging large language models to offer advanced features like summarization and literature review generation.

## 2. Core Features

### 2.1. Paper Discovery

*   **Fetch Papers:** Users can search for and retrieve research papers from various sources directly through the CLI.
    *   Supported sources include: IEEE, Springer, Elsevier, arXiv, and other major academic databases.
*   **Targeted Search:** The search functionality will allow users to find papers based on keywords, authors, and topics.
*   **Historical Context:** The tool will provide a feature to find foundational papers, highly-cited breakthrough papers, and recent studies related to a given topic.

### 2.2. Paper Analysis

*   **Detailed Breakdowns:** Users can request a detailed analysis of a specific research paper.
*   **Summarization:** The tool can generate concise summaries of single or multiple papers.
*   **Literature Review:** The system can generate a comprehensive literature review on a specific topic, identifying trends and research gaps.

### 2.3. User Interaction and Workflow

*   **Interactive Q&A:** Users can engage in a dialogue with the AI to ask questions about the research papers and explore ideas.
*   **Persistent History:** The CLI will maintain a history of user queries and conversations, allowing users to resume their work across sessions.
*   **Paper Management:** Users can save and organize a collection of selected research papers for easy access.

## 3. Technical Specifications

### 3.1. CLI Framework

*   **Command Handling:** Typer will be used for defining and managing CLI commands.
*   **Interactive REPL:** `prompt_toolkit` will be implemented to provide a rich, interactive shell (REPL).
*   **Output Formatting:** Rich will be used for creating beautiful and readable terminal outputs.
*   **User Prompts:** `InquirerPy` will be used for creating user-friendly interactive prompts and selection menus.

### 3.2. AI and Language Model Integration

*   **LLM Backend:** The system will be designed to be compatible with various LLM providers, including OpenAI, Anthropic, and Gemini.
*   **Orchestration:** LangChain or a similar framework will be used to orchestrate the interactions between the LLM, data sources, and tools.
*   **Memory Management:** A memory layer will be implemented using Redis, SQLite, or LangChain's built-in memory modules to provide persistent conversation history.
*   **Vector Database:** A vector database will be used for efficient similarity searches and retrieval of information.

### 3.3. Data Sources and Integrations

*   **Academic Databases:** The application will integrate with APIs or scraping methods to fetch data from IEEE, Springer, Elsevier, and arXiv.
*   **Local File System:** The tool will be able to read and write files to the user's local desktop for saving summaries and other generated content.

## 4. User Interface and Interaction

*   **REPL Meta-Commands:** The REPL will support meta-commands like `:quit` to exit and `:help` to display available commands.
*   **Cancellation:** `Ctrl+C` will cancel the current operation without exiting the application. A double press of `Ctrl+C` will exit the application.

## 5. Error Handling and System Behavior

*   **Graceful Error Handling:** The application will handle errors gracefully, providing clear and informative messages to the user.
*   **Network Issues:** If the tool is unable to connect to external APIs or databases, it will notify the user and allow them to retry the operation.
*   **Invalid Input:** The CLI will provide helpful feedback if the user provides invalid commands or parameters.
